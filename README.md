My chess engine

This is a chess engine I am working on. The final goal is to implement a neural network that plays chess. 
So far, a minimax algorithm has been implemented. 
If you want to run the code, you will need to put .png or .jpeg files in the images folder. The names must match the names contained in the readme file in the images folder.
